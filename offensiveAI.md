I am the head of the `Offensive AI Research Lab` in the BGU Cyber Security Research Center. Our lab investigates how adversaries use and abuse AI to perform malicious tasks such as performign phishing with deepfakes, evading cyber defenses, and performing attack automation. Our goal is to identify and prevent these emerging threats before they become mainstream.
